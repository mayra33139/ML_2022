United Airlines cuts 2012 flying plans
March 13, 2012
NEW YORK (AP) -- United Airlines says it will cut 2012 flying as fuel prices continue to rise.

United, which is the world's biggest airline, said on Tuesday that it will cut flying this year by a half-percent to 1.5 percent. Previously it had said it would do roughly the same amount of flying this year as it did in 2011.

Airlines including United have tried to limit flying so they can charge enough on the seats that remain to cover their expenses. Jet fuel prices have risen 4 percent so far this year compared to 2011.

"We're going to continue a disciplined approach to capacity so we can focus on making money," CEO Jeff Smisek said at a JPMorgan conference in New York.

Airlines can cut capacity by focusing on shorter routes or by using their bigger planes less.

Shares of United's parent, Chicago-based United Continental Holdings Inc., rose 30 cents to $19.92 in midday trading.
