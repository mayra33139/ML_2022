Fuel costs are dragging profits down

Net income for 2Q was $329 million, well ahead of last year's loss of $434 million but lagging behind the $1.05 billion in Q2 2019. To illustrate how fuel costs are hurting airlines, in 2Q22, United Airlines (United) spent $3.81 billion compared to $2.38 billion in 2Q2019 on fuel. That extra $1.43 billion fuel expense came despite United operating 15% less capacity this year. In the second quarter of 2022, it paid an average fuel price per gallon of $4.18, compared to $1.97 in 2021 and $2.16 in 2019.

In a buoyant statement, United said: "The second quarter results combined with continued progress the company is seeing affirms United's confidence in achieving the long-term adjusted pre-tax margin targets of approximately 9% in 2023 and about 14% in 2026 that are part of the United Next strategy." In 2Q the adjusted operating margin was 8.2%. United also had record-setting TRASM (total revenue per available seat mile), which was up by 24% compared to 2Q19, and it expects that comparison to be around 24%-26% in the third quarter.


Headwinds are coming but Kirby is confident

United expects the US economy to slow in the near to medium term but says that will be countered by the continuing pandemic recovery "that is more than offsetting economic headwinds." The airline expects revenue and earnings to accelerate in the third quarter and be profitable for 2022. CEO Scott Kirby said that while it was nice to return to profitability, United had to confront three risks that could grow over the next six to eighteen months.

"Industry-wide operational challenges that limit the system's capacity, record fuel prices and the increasing possibility of a global recession are each real challenges that we are already addressing. These fundamental challenges have already led to higher costs, higher fuel prices but, also higher revenue, which means we're as confident as ever we will deliver on our 9% adjusted pre-tax margin target in 2023."

United announced several new or resumed destinations from various US airports, destinations, including two nonstop services from San Francisco International Airport (SFO) to the Australian destinations of Brisbane International Airport (BNE) and Melbourne Airport (MEL). It also launched a new alliance with Virgin Australia, providing connections throughout Australia and the US to passengers of both airlines.


United also announced its biggest transatlantic expansion by opening ten new routes, including destinations in Jordan, Norway, France, Portugal and Spain. Other new routes to complement the 24 routes resumed in 2Q are Cape Town in South Africa, Tokyo and Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands.
