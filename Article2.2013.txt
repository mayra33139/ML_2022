CHICAGO, Sept. 10, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- United Airlines today launched an expanded premium beverage menu at its U.S.-based United Club lounges, offering customers local and imported beer choices and a wider selection of wines and spirits for purchase.

Regionals, Imports and Microbrews
United now offers customers as many as 27 imported, regional and microbrew beers for purchase in addition to complimentary domestic beer. The airline expects to rotate the premium beer menu several times a year.

The beer options include: Anchor Steam, Asahi, Blue Moon, Blue Point, Brooklyn Lager, Corona, Fat Tire, Florida IPA, Goose Island, Great Lakes-Dortmunder Gold, Guinness, Heineken, Hurricane Reef Caribbean Pilsner, Inversion IPA, Karl Strauss, Leinenkugel, Long Board, Maritime, Pyramid, San Tan, Shiner, Sierra Nevada, Speakeasy IPA, Saint Arnold and Yuengling.

Premium Spirits and Wines
In addition to expanding the premium beer offerings, United is offering customers a greater selection of spirits and wines at U.S.-based United Club locations. New wine options include a Joel Gott Cabernet Sauvignon, Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc, a Donna Paula Malbec and Veuve Cliquot Champagne. Added spirits include Ketel One, Stolichnaya, Hendrick's Gin, 10 Cane and Hennessey XO.

Additionally, United Clubs in several of the airline's hubs, including Chicago O'Hare, New York/Newark, Los Angeles, Houston and Washington Dulles, will offer members a complimentary guided tasting of Glenfiddich until the end of the year. A custom-made bar will offer customers a dedicated area to enjoy a pre-departure dram while learning about whisky.

Availability of the new beers, wines and spirits will vary by club location.

"The newly expanded premium beverage menu offers customers more of what they expect in a beverage selection when visiting an airport lounge," said Martin Hand, senior vice president of customer experience at United. "We are investing in our clubs and providing our customers with more ways to relax and enjoy greater local and global specialties, including regional microbrews and premium wines."

United Club Investments
In addition to expanding the premium beverage offerings, United is investing more than $50 million this year to renovate several of the airline's 49 United Club locations. United unveiled the new design prototype with the opening of the United Club in Terminal 2 at Chicago O'Hare International Airport last year. The airline recently opened newly designed United Clubs at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and San Diego International Airport.

As with all United Club lounges, members enjoy complimentary snacks, beverages and Wi-Fi.
